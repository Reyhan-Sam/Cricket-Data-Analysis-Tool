# T20 Cricket World Cup'22 Analysis

This project is a thorough analysis of the T20 Cricket World Cup 2022 players' performances. The aim is to identify the best performers and compile the ultimate team of 11, deemed the best in the world based on different metrics such as average run rate, strike rate, batting average and more.

## Project Overview

The data for this project was sourced from ESPN Cricinfo. The initial step involved scraping the data using JavaScript on the Bright Data platform, which provides a powerful online parser. The data was first extracted into JSON files, meticulously pre-processed, cleaned, and visualized into data frames for an intial idea using the Pandas library in Python via juypter notebook, and finally exported as CSV files to be utilized in Power BI.

For a detailed look at the data cleaning and preprocessing, check the Jupyter notebook here: [t20_python.ipynb](t20_python.ipynb).

## Power BI Visualization

The processed data was then used to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. This interactive visualization tool provides insights into the players' performances and helps in the decision-making process for selecting the top performers.

Here is a brief recording showcasing the interactive Power BI dashboard:
